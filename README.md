# bunny-birthday-bash-game
This was a light-hearted personal project for a friend’s birthday—built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with media assets in a creative way.

## 🌟 The Story Behind
Once, three friends worked together and shared laughter, coffee breaks, and dreams. Life took the two boys—Hippo and Fox—on different journeys. Bunny stayed back, and time drifted. This little game is a heartfelt attempt to bridge that gap with joy and humor.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Hit the **Hippo** 🦛 and **Fox** 🦊 characters for points.
- Avoid hitting the **Lion** 🦁 (Bunny’s husband) — or it's game over!
- Reach 120 points to win the game and see a special birthday surprise.

## 🎁 Features
- Custom artwork based on personal nicknames and shared memories
- Funny ending screens with cakes and surprises 🎂
- Click or tap-friendly
- Works in browsers, no installation needed
